#### 🤔What is a blog?

🔑The blog is a form of website where its content is presented in reverse chronological order (i.e. the latest content appears in the first position).

🙎🏻‍♂️Blogs are usually operated by individuals or a small group of people, presenting information in the form of dialogue. However, many large companies now use blogs to publish information and opinions to the outside world.

✍🏻Blog articles also have a comment section where users can leave comments on the article.
